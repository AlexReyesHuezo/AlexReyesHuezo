I'm Alex, a *Web developer* from El Salvador, who is passionate about **Web Accessibility**.

How rewarding it is to get the web right! That's why I'm constantly learning about open web standards to achieve semantic and consistent masterpieces. You can ask me about *HTML*, *CSS*, *JavaScript* and *WCAG* standards. I'm comfortable developing on Linux terminals and version control systems.

I'm open to learn new technology stacks, by the other hand areas like Developer Experience 👨🏻‍💻, WebAssembly 🧩, Web Mapping 🌎 and Cryptography 🔐 especially call my attention.

I am guided by these principles: **integrity**, **respect**, **collaboration**, **never stop learning** and **not giving up**.

### ⚡ Fun facts
- I love to read scientific papers and books.
- I'm fond of study math and physics.
